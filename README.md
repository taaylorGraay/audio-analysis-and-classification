# audio-analysis-and-classification
The aim of this work was to combine audio analysis and classification algorithms to compare, and automatically classify, two groups of sounds.  The two groups I was interested in classifying electronic and live samples. Analysis parameters used were all taken from the MIR Toolbox for MATLAB (mirenvelope, mirrms, mirrolloff, mirroughness, mironsets).
